=head1 NAME

finddisowned - find files that are disowned by package manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<finddisowned> [I<OPTION>]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<finddisowned> lists the files that are disowned by package manager.

In particular, finddisowned compares the package database with
contents of the directories described in F</etc/finddisowned.conf>.

B<finddisowned> does not compare the package database with the entire
file system, but only with files from directories described in
F</etc/finddisowned.conf> because the entire file system contains
directories such as F</home>, F</mnt> and even dynamic directories
like F</proc>, F</dev>, etc, the contents of which are definitely not
taken into account (and should not be) by package manager.

Feel free to adjust the configuration file (F</etc/finddisowned.conf>)
conform your needs.
